## Onboarding Tool-kit

This is the onboarding session for your first telepresence experience. To get you started, we believe there are 3 main lessons you need. First you need to setup your Google Calendar, so all your communications  with students is centralized. This includes where to find the links to the shared folder for work submission, links to your recorded lectures, and links to video conference sessions. Second is to show you how to record your lectures. We highly recommend you record anything that can be recorded. Last but not least, is how to conduct video conference and interact with students in real time. 

With these 3 pieces of information, you should be able to get yourself a basic setup. If you are an advanced user and are already familiar with our basic setup, you can visit our Wiki page for more advanced tool-set and work-flow recommendations.  

If you require any assistance in any way, please contact our Technical Support staff at 718.636.3765 or [techsupport@pratt.edu](mailto:techsupport@pratt.edu).
