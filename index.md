## Onboarding Took-kit

This is the onboarding session for your first telepresence experience. To get you started, we believe there are 3 main lessons you need. First you need to setup your Google Calendar, so all your communications  with students is centralized. They include where to find the links to the shared folder for work submission, link to your recorded lecture, and link to the video conference session. Second is to show you how to record your lecture. We highly recommend you record anything that could be recorded. Last but not least, is how to conduct video conference and interact with students in real time. 

With these 3 pieces of information, you should be able to get yourself a basic setup. If you are an advanced user and are already familiar with our basic setup, you can visit our Wiki page for more advanced tool-set and work-flow recommendation.  

If you require any assistance in any way, please contact our Technical Support staff at 718.636.3765 or [techsupport@pratt.edu](mailto:techsupport@pratt.edu).
