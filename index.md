## Pratt Telepresence

This is the onboarding session for your first telepresence experience. To get you started, we believe there are 3 main lessons you need to get you started. First is to setup your Calendar so all your communication with students is centralized. Second is to show you how to record your lecture. We highly recommend you record anything that could be recorded. Last but not least, is how to conduct video conference in real time. 

With these 3 pieces of information, you should be able to get yourself setup. If you require any assistance in any way, please contact our Technical Support staff at 718.636.3765 or [techsupport@pratt.edu](mailto:techsupport@pratt.edu).
