## Step 1. Schedule and Organize
**Setup Time : Approx. 10min**.

------



When moving all your courses online, the single most important factor is how you and your students find where things are. We have 2 main methods of sharing files with students, **Google Drive** and **LMS**. If you have never used LMS before, we recommend just using Google Drive.  





#### Setting up Google Drive

1. Artec handheld 3D scanners (Eva and Spider models for large and small objects)
2. NextEngine 3D scanner (for small objects)
3. Universal Laser VLS 6.50 laser cutter (for 2D cutting and engraving)



#### Sharing files in LMS

1. Files are accepted in .stl or .obj format. Files may only be submitted in person and must be paid for at submission using PrattBucks.

2. Your object must fit on the print bed. Print bed sizes are:

3. TAZ 6: 280mm (11”) x 280mm (11”) x 250mm (9.8”)

4. Objet 30 Prime: 294mm (11.5”) x 192mm (7.5”) x 148 mm (5.9”)

5. Solidscape: 152.3mm (6”) x 152.4mm (6”) x 101.6mm (4”)

6. All files for 3D printing must be checked for errors prior to submission in Magics RP. Your file must be perfect in all categories in the Fix Wizard except Intersecting and Overlapping Triangles, where you may have less than 300 Intersecting Triangles and less than 300 Overlapping Triangles. Your file will be checked in the lab before your submission will be accepted. See our guide on file fixing in Magics ([Download guide](http://labs.pratt.edu/resources/printing/pdf/magics_design_guide_F19.pdf?_ga=2.196701676.1925286507.1582138075-2024070087.1582138075), available also in the Help Files). Magics RP is available for use on all PCs in the Machinery and Engineering labs.




#### Setting up Google Calendar

1. Pricing for each material is based on material used (including support material as necessary), print time, and for plastic, quality chosen. Students may submit a file for a quote simply by bringing it to the lab.

2. Tip: Hollowing your objects for resin printing will result in a much cheaper print!

3. Flat surface: To print in plastic on the TAZ 6, your object must have a flat surface that can be placed on the print bed. You may have to cut your object so there is a flat surface. For organic shapes, it can be a smart idea to cut your file in half and glue the two halves together later.






Print guide – Recommended wall thickness, hole sizes, etc. as well as submission guidelines and lab policies can be found in our [3D Print Design Guide](http://labs.pratt.edu/resources/printing/pdf/3dprint_design_guide_F19.pdf?_ga=2.196701676.1925286507.1582138075-2024070087.1582138075).
