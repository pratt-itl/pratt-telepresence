#### Tips



- We recommend that you make Google Drive or LMS the primary “home base” for your course. You can find many helpful guides here ???. Before March 23, set up a google drive folder or your LMS page for each course you are teaching.
  
- Send an email before classes resume letting your students know when and how the class will meet and whether there will be any major changes to the remaining assignments in the semester. If you do not have an email list goto to your roster online or contact your chairperson. Also, let students know the best way to communicate with you for the rest of the term.
  
- When moving all your courses online, the single most important factor is how you and your students find where things are. We have 2 main methods of sharing files with students, **Google Drive** and **LMS**. If you have never used LMS before, we recommend just using Google Drive.
