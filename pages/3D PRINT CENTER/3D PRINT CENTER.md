**Location :** 

Engineering Building, 2nd Floor, Room 211

**Hours of Operation :**

MTWTFSS, 8:30am - Midnight



------



The 3D Printing Center is Pratt’s centralized hub for 3D printing and 3D scanning. The facility is open to students and staff of all disciplines. We offer a variety of 3D printers and materials to fit different stages of the design process—from prototyping, to printed waxes for lost-wax casting, to presentation-quality resin prints.

The facility is staffed by an enthusiastic and knowledgeable group of student monitors, who in addition to performing all 3D scanning and 3D printing duties, design useful items for the 3D Printing Center that we 3D print in-house and use every day. These designs are available to the public on our [Thingiverse page](http://www.thingiverse.com/Pratt3DPrinting/designs).



#### EQUIPMENT

- TAZ 6 3D Printers (for initial prototyping)
  *Material: PLA plastic (various colors), Bronze, Copper and Bamboo composite plastics, and Ninjaflex (TPU, and Polysmooth)*
- Solidscape S350 3D Printer (for use in lost-wax casting)
  *Material: Castable Wax*
- Objet 30 Prime (for presentation-quality models)
  *Material: Resin ((white, black, clear)* 
- Artec handheld 3D scanners (Eva and Spider models for large and small objects)
- NextEngine 3D scanner (for small objects)
- Universal Laser VLS 6.50 laser cutter (for 2D cutting and engraving)



#### 3D PRINTING SUBMISSION GUIDELINES

Files are accepted in .stl or .obj format. Files may only be submitted in person and must be paid for at submission using PrattBucks.

Your object must fit on the print bed. Print bed sizes are:

TAZ 6: 280mm (11”) x 280mm (11”) x 250mm (9.8”)

Objet 30 Prime: 294mm (11.5”) x 192mm (7.5”) x 148 mm (5.9”)

Solidscape: 152.3mm (6”) x 152.4mm (6”) x 101.6mm (4”)

All files for 3D printing must be checked for errors prior to submission in Magics RP. Your file must be perfect in all categories in the Fix Wizard except Intersecting and Overlapping Triangles, where you may have less than 300 Intersecting Triangles and less than 300 Overlapping Triangles. Your file will be checked in the lab before your submission will be accepted. See our guide on file fixing in Magics ([Download guide](http://labs.pratt.edu/resources/printing/pdf/magics_design_guide_F19.pdf?_ga=2.196701676.1925286507.1582138075-2024070087.1582138075), available also in the Help Files). Magics RP is available for use on all PCs in the Machinery and Engineering labs.



#### PRICING FOR 3D PRINTING

Pricing for each material is based on material used (including support material as necessary), print time, and for plastic, quality chosen. Students may submit a file for a quote simply by bringing it to the lab.

Tip: Hollowing your objects for resin printing will result in a much cheaper print!

Flat surface: To print in plastic on the TAZ 6, your object must have a flat surface that can be placed on the print bed. You may have to cut your object so there is a flat surface. For organic shapes, it can be a smart idea to cut your file in half and glue the two halves together later.

Naming convention – files for all printers must be named in the following convention:

​                                Onekey_date_description

​                                Ex: amarco70_2_1_17_ring

Print guide – Recommended wall thickness, hole sizes, etc. as well as submission guidelines and lab policies can be found in our [3D Print Design Guide](http://labs.pratt.edu/resources/printing/pdf/3dprint_design_guide_F19.pdf?_ga=2.196701676.1925286507.1582138075-2024070087.1582138075).
