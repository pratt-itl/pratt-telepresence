**Learning Time : Approx. 15min**.

<strong id="introduction">Tips for Recording</strong> 

- **Clear audio is most important**, so be sure you have a good microphone and a quiet location for recording.
- **Perfect production quality isn’t necessary**; you can talk extemporaneously as you would in a classroom setting and not worry about small bobbles of speech or misspeaking in small ways. However, if you decide you’ve made more errors than you would like, just stop, delete that recording, and start again. Kaltura easily allows clipping the beginning and end off of a recording, but to do more significant editing you will need to download the recording mp4 file, edit in a different software, and then share the edited file outside of ??? (Kaltura is a good option for this). If you will be switching between different materials within one recording, prepare them first (have them open on your computer) so you can easily switch from one view to the next. 
- **Shorter and more concise recordings are better.** They hold the student’s attention longer, and they are easier for you to record. Try to keep each recording under 10 minutes (under 7 minutes is better). If necessary, make two videos to explain the concepts, rather than one long one. 
- **Use a recording method/tool that allows you to store your recordings in the cloud**, so you need only share the link with students rather than uploading/downloading large video files.

<strong id="kaltura">Kaltura</strong> - This is the tool to use if you want to record and narrate over the screen. 

1. The Zund can handle a range of materials but principally should be utilized as a tool for those materials that are not suitable for a laser cutter or a CNC mill. Broadly speaking this may cover materials with an aerated interior, materials that react or break down with heat, materials that exceed a laser bed or those that would be too difficult to clamp down to a CNC mill. 

2. The benefits of the Zund Blade system is that the tooling operation does not introduce heat or burn to the material resulting in no off gassing, burn mark, loss of precision or other unintended negatives that heat introduction to materials produces.

1. Expanding the offering beyond precision cutting the Zund workflow works in concert with 2D printing allowing for graphic artwork to be output on 2 ply and 4 ply Bristol as well as all of the fabrics and papers currently offered within the 2D output center. Integration of printing and cutting as a folded workflow should include registration dots in order to sync the printed artwork with the vector cut file.

2. The G3 Zund 3200 Digital Cutting system has the feature for roll stock cutting allowing for a theoretical infinite y-axis cutting dimension. Utilizing roll stock goods with either edge or dot registration in conjunction with the conveyor bed and vacuum hold down provides precision continuous cutting over greater than 12’ lengths or maximizes efficiency by only having to load one material good and continuously feeding new, to cut multiples.
