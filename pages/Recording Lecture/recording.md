**Learning Time : Approx. 15min**.

<strong id="introduction">Tips for Recording</strong> 

- **Clear audio is most important**, so be sure you have a good microphone and a quiet location for recording.
- **Perfect production quality isn’t necessary**; you can talk extemporaneously as you would in a classroom setting and not worry about small bobbles of speech or misspeaking in small ways. However, if you decide you’ve made more errors than you would like, just stop, delete that recording, and start again. Kaltura easily allows clipping the beginning and end off of a recording, but to do more significant editing you will need to download the recording mp4 file, edit in a different software, and then share the edited file outside of ??? (Kaltura is a good option for this). If you will be switching between different materials within one recording, prepare them first (have them open on your computer) so you can easily switch from one view to the next. 
- **Shorter and more concise recordings are better.** They hold the student’s attention longer, and they are easier for you to record. Try to keep each recording under 10 minutes (under 7 minutes is better). If necessary, make two videos to explain the concepts, rather than one long one. 
- **Use a recording method/tool that allows you to store your recordings in the cloud**, so you need only share the link with students rather than uploading/downloading large video files.
